# Disney World Date and Attendance Predictor

## Project Overview

There are 58 million people that go to Disney World in Orlando, FL every year. It is no secret that some days are incredibly busier than others and lines can seem like a mile long. Vi sitorsspend tons of money to provide an unforgettable experience for their family and want to have a great time. Depending on the time of year they go, that experience can be absolutely magnificient. I want people to have the same unforgettable experience with their loved ones as I have had in the past, without all the extra worries that can be avoidable, if planned correctly. 

Using the dataset, I will predict when the perfect time is to go to Disney World. 

### Business Problems

These were my guiding questions in which my project was modeled:

<ul>
  <li>When is the most ideal time to go to Disney World to avoid long lines with kids?</li>
  <li>hen is the most ideal time to go to Disney World to avoid long lines without kids?</li>
  <li>When is the most ideal time to go to a specific Disney park: Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom?</li>
  <li>What is the best time to ride a particular ride?</li>
  </ul>
  
### Recommendations

## Data

I will build these models based on the wait times for the most popular rides from the 4 parks at Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL. 
<ul>
  <li>Magic Kingdom</li>
  <li>Epcot</li>
  <li>Hollywood Studios</li>
