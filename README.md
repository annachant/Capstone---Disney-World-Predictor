## Project Overview

There are 58 million people that go to Disney World in Orlando, FL every year. It is no secret that some days are incredibly busier than others and lines can seem like a mile long. Vi sitorsspend tons of money to provide an unforgettable experience for their family and want to have a great time. Depending on the time of year they go, that experience can be absolutely magnificient. I want people to have the same unforgettable experience with their loved ones as I have had in the past, without all the extra worries that can be avoidable, if planned correctly. 

Using the dataset, I will predict when the perfect time is to go to Disney World's 4 parks:

<ul>
  <li>Magic Kingdom</li>
  <li>Epcot</li>
  <li>Hollywood Studios</li>
  <li>Animal Kingdom</li>
  </ul>


### Business Problems

These were my guiding questions in which my project was modeled:

<ul>
  <li>When is the most ideal time to go to Disney World to avoid long lines with kids?</li>
  <li>When is the most ideal time to go to Disney World to avoid long lines without kids?</li>
  <li>When is the most ideal time to go to a specific Disney park: Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom?</li>
  <li>What is the best time to ride a particular ride?</li>
  <li>On a given day, is it a good day to go to that particular theme park?</li>
  </ul>
  
### Recommendations

I will recommend the following:

## Data

The dataset was obtained from https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/crowd-calendar#DataSets. It contains wait time information that was collected every 5-10 minutes for the top rides in Disney World from January 2015 to Dec 2021. There are wait times for the following 12 rides across all 4 parks:

<ul>
  <li>Magic Kingdom</li>
      - Seven Dwarfs Mine Train
      - Pirates of the Caribbean
      - Splash Mountain
   
  <li>Epcot</li>
      - Soarin
      - Spaceship Earth
  
  <li>Hollywood Studios</li>
      - Rock n Rollercoaster
      - Slinky Dog Ride
      - Toy Story Mania
  
  <li>Animal Kingdom</li>
      - Dinosaur
      - Expedition Everest
      - Kilimajaro Safari
      - Navi River
  </ul>



### Exploratory Data Analysis 

The data was cleaned and the following was completed in order to get the most accurate and best analysis:
<ul>
<li>The data used used for the analysis was from 1/1/2015 to 12/31/2019 </li>
  <li>Data was resampled from every 5/10 minutes per day to a daily average per day </li>
 <li>Slinky dog ride was excluded from the analysis due to it beung newer and there is not enough data to make asn accurate prediction</li>
  </ul>
